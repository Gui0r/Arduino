# Overview of the Improved Arduino 4-bit Binary Adder Code
### The improved Arduino code is designed to read two 4-bit binary numbers from input pins, perform binary addition when a control signal is active, and output the result to output pins. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the main components and functionality:
