# Binary Adder Project with Arduino

## Description
This project implements a 4-bit binary adder using an Arduino board. The adder takes two 4-bit binary numbers, performs the addition, and displays the result.

## Overview
The code utilizes basic Arduino functions to read digital inputs, perform addition and carry operations, and write digital outputs. The addition operation is triggered by a control signal read on digital pin 13.

## Installation
1. Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Copy the code .
3. Paste the code into the Arduino IDE.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage
1. Configure the hardware according to the specifications:
   - Connect binary inputs to digital pins 0 to 7.
   - Connect the control signal to digital pin 13.
   - Connect outputs for results to digital pins 8 to 12.
2. Run the uploaded code on the Arduino board.
3. Define the binary inputs and control signal.
4. Observe the outputs on the designated pins to see the sum result.
